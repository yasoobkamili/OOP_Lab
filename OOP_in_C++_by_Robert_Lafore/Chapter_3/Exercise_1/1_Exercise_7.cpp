// Write a program that calculates how much money youâ€™ll end up with if you invest an
// amount of money at a fixed interest rate, compounded yearly. Have the user furnish the
// initial amount, the number of years, and the yearly interest rate in percent. Some interac-
// tion with the program might look like this:
// Enter initial amount: 3000
// Enter number of years: 10
// Enter interest rate (percent per year): 5.5
// At the end of 10 years, you will have 5124.43 dollars.
// At the end of the first year you have 3000 + (3000 * 0.055), which is 3165. At the end of
// the second year you have 3165 + (3165 * 0.055), which is 3339.08. Do this as many
// times as there are years. A for loop makes the calculation easy.
